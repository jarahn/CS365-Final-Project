    <h1 class= "title">Node JS</h1>
   
    <p class="descrip">Node is a free, open source JavaScript runtime environment. 
        It allows for Javascript to be executed outside of the the browser, 
        allowing for us to create non blocking asyncronous applications.
        This is done by using a singular thread to talk between a server/database, the clients and an event queue.
        The thread checks the event queue to know when the server/database has returned.
        Node js is great for building IO heavy applications or when you know you need to access the database often.

    <h2 class="infoTitle">Node setup, Package manager and installation</h2>
    <div id="nodeSetup">
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">1. Download the latest version of node, or check to see if you have with "node -v" in the command line</a></li>
            <li>2. Node uses a package manager titled "node package manager" NPM for short. In order to start a project we have to initialize our project for node.
                <br>
                This is done with the cmd "NPM init", it creates a json file in the working directory with all the information node needs to function.
            </li>
            <li>3.Now that we have node installed and initialized we can download any other libraries we want with the NPM command.
                <br>
                A great example is the "express" library. "NPM install express" will add all related setup info for the express library into the json file that init created.
            </li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
    <p class="info">Pros: Scalability, use of Javascript, Large amount of open source downloadables, great for IO heavy apps</p>
    <p class="info">Cons: not good for CPU heavy apps(video or images) this is bc node is single threaded and has t owait while it does calculations </p>
