    <h1 class= "title">Node JS</h1>
   
    <p class="descrip">Node is a free, open source JavaScript runtime environment.
        <br>
        It allows for Javascript to be executed outside of the the browser,
        <br>
        allowing for us to create non blocking asyncronous applications.
        <br>
        This is done by using a singular thread to talk between a server/database, the clients and an event queue.
        <br>
        The thread checks the event queue to know when the server/database has returned.
        <br>
        Node js is great for building IO heavy applications or when you know you need to access the database often.
        <br>
        It offers great performance on almost all operating systems.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="infoTitle">Node setup, Package manager and installation</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">1. Download the latest version of node, or check to see if you have with "node -v" in the command line</a>
    <br>
    2. Node uses a package manager titled "node package manager" NPM for short. In order to start a project we have to initialize our project for node.
    This is done with the cmd "NPM init", it creates a json file in the working directory with all the information node needs to function.
    <br>
    3.Now that we have node installed and initialized we can download any other libraries we want with the NPM command.
    A great example is the "express" library. "NPM install express" will add all related setup info for the express library into the json file that init created.
    </p>
    <h2>Get, Post</h2>
    <p class="info">Get and post are both http requests that handle </p>
    <h2>Express</h2>
    <p>Express is a node js framework used to create a webpages backend. 
    It is used to handle http requests and routes as well as setting ports. Just like Node express also has a multitude of libraries that can be installed and used when needed.
    Express operates by directing the program what function should be called for each http request type and route. 
    </p>
    <h2>Express Code Example using socket.IO:</h2>
    <img src="img/expressImage.png">
    <p>1.We require("express") in order to ensure that we include the express module
    <br>
    2. We then create an express object named app and create a http server object with http.Server("app")
    <br>
    3. app.use(express.static("pub")) signals to express to allow for us to load files that are in the pub folder. These lines of code are most of the reason youre able to view the webpage right now.
    </p>
    <h2>Running and connecting to a node server on localhost</h2>
    <p>in order to run your server:
    <br>
    1. open the command line and navigate to your projects directory/where you called npm init.
    <br>
    2. run the command "node nameOfServerCode.js" where the argument is the name of the file that contians your server code, this starts the server. 
    Makesure you keep the command line open, if you close it your server turns off.
    <br>
    3. In order to connect to your server, go to your preferd browser and go to "127.0.0.1". This is the ip of your machine, the "localhost"
    Once you connect to that url/ip you should get a message in the command line saying "sombody connected" as well as your webpage displaying in your browser.
    </p>


    <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
    <p class="info">Pros: Scalability, use of Javascript, Large amount of open source downloadables, great for IO heavy apps</p>
    <p class="info">Cons: not good for CPU heavy apps(video or images) this is due to node being single threaded.</p>
    
    <h2>Companies that utilize Node</h2>
    <p class="info">Paypal, Go Daddy, Groupon, IBM, LinkedIn, Microsoft
    <br>
    Node is found among almost all online web apps
