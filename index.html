        <p class="info">CS365 - Client Side Web Development - is a class offered to Northern Michigan University students and
             required for the mobile application and web development major.</p>
        <p class="info">This guide will serve as an overview to CS365 as well as a reference to the technologies learned in class.</p>
        
        <h2 class="descrip">What is client side web development?</h2>
        <p class="info">A client side application is the program that runs on the client machine (browser) and deals 
            with the user interface/display and any other processing that can happen on a client machine.
            <br>
                The main functions of a client side program are:
            <br>
                1) Interact with temporary storage
            <br>
                2) Make interactive web pages
            <br>
                3) Interact with local storage
            <br>
                4) Sending request for data to server
            <br>
                5) Send request to server
            <br>
                6) work as an interface between server and user
            </p>

        <h2 class="serve">Servers</h2>
        <p class="info">Servers are used to "store" information. They allow for multiple client connections and facilitate
            keeping data consistent and correct across clients.
